## Description

employeeDirectory is a React application that allows a user to view their entiree employee directory as soon as the page loads.  This allows the user to have quick access to important employee information including their first and last name, email,cell and location (city and state).  The rendered table of employees also includes their photo.  The table of employees can be searched by either providing a full search term such as the complete first name,  or only a few characters that will render the employee that has that information included in their name, email, phone or location.  The lisit can be sorted by the employees first name alphabetically.
